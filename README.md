# Assignment  - Retro Arcade E-Commerce Analysis

## Description
This repository is focused on building and analyzing an e-commerce system for retro arcade game machines. The project simulates an e-commerce web site's backend, detailing product management and order processing in Python.

## Assignment Structure
- **Part A - Create a Product Class:** Develops a Python class representing products sold on the e-commerce site.
- **Part B - Instantiate a Test Product Object:** Demonstrates how to create and work with instances of the product class.
- **Part C - Create an Order Class:** Constructs a class to handle customer orders, including state-specific sales tax calculations.
- **Part D - Instantiate a Test Order Object:** Shows how to create an order instance, including a shopping cart with multiple products.

## Business Context
- The project caters to a niche market of hobbyists interested in creating retro home arcade game machines.
- It includes a catalog of ten products available for purchase.
- The sales system considers different U.S. state sales tax rates, which is critical for accurate pricing and compliance.

## Files
- `GBA-465-A-3-Mantri-Astha.ipynb` - The Jupyter Notebook containing all the Python code for class definitions, product, and order management.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Ensure Python is installed and run the notebook using a Jupyter interface to interact with the classes and objects.
3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to test the e-commerce system.

## Technologies
- Python
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles
- Jupyter Notebook

## Objective
The primary objective of this assignment is to apply OOP principles in Python to simulate a basic e-commerce backend, manage a product catalog, and process orders considering variable tax rates.
